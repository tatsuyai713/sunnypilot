## Enforce Factory Longitudinal Control

When enabled, sunnypilot does not control gas or brakes. The factory Toyota/Lexus adaptive cruise control system handles all speed control. sunnypilot still provides steering assistance.

Enabling this will disable sunnypilot longitudinal control, disable Alpha Longitudinal if it was enabled, and force Stop and Go Hack off. A confirmation dialog appears before activation.

!!! note "Availability"
    Cannot be changed while the system is engaged (actively driving).

## Stop and Go Hack (Alpha)

Allows some Toyota and Lexus vehicles to automatically resume from a full stop during stop-and-go traffic. Without this, you must press the resume button or tap the gas to resume.

!!! warning "Alpha Feature"
    This is an alpha-quality feature. Use at your own risk.

!!! note "Availability"
    Requires sunnypilot longitudinal control to be available and enabled. **Enforce Factory Longitudinal Control** must be off. Cannot be changed while engaged.
