## Joystick Debug Mode

Enables joystick-controlled driving for testing and development purposes.

!!! note "Availability"
    Hidden on release branches. Can only be changed while the device is offroad.

---

## Longitudinal Maneuver Mode

!!! note "Availability"
    Hidden on release branches. Requires longitudinal control and the device must be offroad.

## sunnypilot Longitudinal Control (Alpha)

Enables alpha-quality longitudinal control for vehicles that do not yet have full upstream support. This replaces the car's stock adaptive cruise control with sunnypilot's own gas and brake management.

## Quickboot Mode

Creates a prebuilt file for accelerated boot, reducing startup time. Requires software updates to be disabled first.
