## Speed Limit Source

A row of five buttons lets you choose the source policy:

| Option | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| **Car Only** | Uses only the speed limit data provided by your vehicle's built-in systems (e.g., traffic sign recognition from the car's cameras) |
| **Map Only** | Uses only OpenStreetMap data for speed limits. Requires a downloaded map database from the [OSM panel](../../osm.md) |
| **Car First** | Checks the car's speed limit data first. Falls back to map data if the car does not report a limit |
| **Map First** | Checks map data first. Falls back to the car's reported limit if no map data is available |
| **Combined** | Uses the higher of the two available values from car and map sources |

!!! tip
    **Car First** is a good default for vehicles with traffic sign recognition. If your vehicle does not have sign recognition, use **Map Only** or **Map First** and make sure you have downloaded the map for your region in the [OSM panel](../../osm.md).
