## Clear Model Cache

A button that deletes all downloaded models except the currently active one. The current cache size in MB is displayed. Useful for freeing storage space.

## Use Lane Turn Desires

When enabled, at speeds of 20 mph (32 km/h) or below with the turn signal on, the model plans a turn in the blinker direction at the nearest drivable path. This helps the model make smoother turns at low speeds.

---

## Adjust Lane Turn Speed

A selector that sets the maximum speed at which lane turn desires are active. Default is 19 mph. Use the **-** and **+** buttons to adjust.

!!! note "Availability"
    Only appears when **Use Lane Turn Desires** is enabled and **Show Advanced Controls** is enabled in [Developer Settings](developer.md).

## Live Learning Steer Delay

Enables real-time learning and adaptive steering response time. The system continuously measures the actual steering delay and adjusts compensation accordingly. When disabled, a fixed response time is used instead.

The description text shows the current live delay value or a breakdown of delay components.

---

## Adjust Software Delay

A selector that sets the fixed software delay value used when Live Learning Steer Delay is disabled. Default is 0.2 seconds. Use the **-** and **+** buttons to adjust.

!!! note "Availability"
    Only appears when **Live Learning Steer Delay** is disabled and **Show Advanced Controls** is enabled in [Developer Settings](developer.md).
